            the principal civilian advisor and assistant to the SECNAV and UNSECNAV on
            the administration of the affairs of the DON. Each staff assistant is the
            principal advisor and assistant to the SECNAV and/or UNSECNAV, for their
            assigned duties, pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 5 of enclosure (1) of this
            instruction. In carrying out these<br />duties, the civilian executive
            assistants, staff assistants, and DUSNs also support the Chief of Naval
            Operations (CNO) and the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) in the
            execution of their responsibilities, as prescribed in references (a) and
            (b).<br /><br />
            a. CNO. The CNO is the principal Navy advisor and Navy executive to the
            SECNAV on the conduct of Navy activities in the DON. The CNO performs
            duties under the authority, direction, and control of the SECNAV and is
            directly responsible to the SECNAV except as otherwise prescribed by
            law.<br /><br />
            b. CMC. The CMC is the principal Marine Corps advisor and Marine Corps
            executive to the SECNAV on the conduct of Marine Corps activities in the

            otherwise prescribed by law.<br /><br />
            c. Commandant of the Coast Guard (COMDT COGARD). When the United States
            Coast Guard is operating as a Service in the Navy upon the declaration of
            war or when directed by the President, the COMDT COGARD performs duties
            under the authority, direction, and control of the SECNAV and is directly
            responsible to the SECNAV except as otherwise prescribed by law.<br /><br />7.
            Governance. The SECNAV assigns responsibilities and authorities for areas
            essential to the efficient administration of the DON to and among the
            UNSECNAV, civilian executive assistants, staff assistants, and DUSNs in
            enclosure (1) of this instruction. The SECNAV retains control of these and
            related policy matters, including the establishment and signature of
            fundamental policies and the issuance of such orders and directives as
            necessary, pursuant to reference (c). All other SECNAV directives or other
            documents assigning responsibilities or authorities within the Secretariat
            that are not addressed herein, and that are inconsistent with this
            instruction, are hereby rescinded.<br /><br />8. Delegation of Authority.
            The SECNAV is frequently assigned additional authorities and
            responsibilities through public laws, Department of Defense (DoD)
            issuances, written memoranda, or less formal assignments. Regardless of
            origin, the details of each assignment shall be captured in writing, and
            the SECNAV may delegate these additional authorities and responsibilities
            not <br />already assigned to a civilian executive assistant, staff
            assistant, or DUSN in writing to the appropriate level in the DON.<br /><br />
            a. The publication of a SECNAV directive as described in reference (c) may
            be necessary to execute these delegations of authority. SECNAV directives
            often include a delegation of authority or assignment of responsibility.
            Directives as described in reference (c) may continue to provide written
            guidance on selected authorities and responsibilities.<br /><br />
            b. Additional delegations shall be made in writing signed by the SECNAV,
            UNSECNAV, CNO, CMC, or cognizant civilian executive assistant, staff
            assistant, or DUSN, coordinated with the appropriate legal office, and a
            copy of the written delegation shall be forwarded to the SECNAV&rsquo;s
